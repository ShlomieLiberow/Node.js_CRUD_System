# Node.js CRUD System Template

Built a single page application CRUD (create, read, update and delete) system. This is my first run at the technologes involved approached with a learn-as-you-go attitude.

This used a fictional legal aid volunteering network as a model to guide the product.

Uses MongoDB for storage, Node.js along with Jade for templating and finally Angular on the front end with a material design finish.
